                    Minesweeper is a personal favorite of mine, and I used to play this game on Windows all the time, so I was interested in coding the logic of this game. The goal of this game is to avoid clicking on mines given the numbers that reveal the number of mines nearby, and the user wins when all mine-free squares are clicked.  <br> <br>
                    Going in, I knew this project was a challenge as it involves numerous classes working together with a functional logic to be implemented in a graphic user interface. As there are numerous elements in the game such as bombs, number warnings, flags, I had to divide the project up into numerous modules to organize code. I was proud to recreate one of my favorite classic games, and I learned the importance of docstrings when a project gets lengthy.
