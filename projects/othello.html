                Othello is a classic board game that uses disks of two different colors. Disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line bounded by disks of the player's color are flipped and switched into the player's color, and the aim of the game is to have the majority of disks flipped to your color.  <br> <br>
                This project was particularly challenging as I had to implement the logic of the game correctly before creating the graphic user interface. The user also gets to specify the dimension of the game board, starting color, winning condition, and starting board position, which will be finalized in the starting menu. The project taught me the importance of setting up working functions before rushing to code as it takes a lot of time to debug previous, faulty functions.
